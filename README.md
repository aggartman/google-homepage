This will be my first test project on utilizing the lessons I've learned through the foundations HTML and CSS courses in The Odin Project. 



The homepage of Google is an iconic webpage that has become a daily part of life for so many of us. All you need is a Rubber Duck (His name is Ducky) and Google afterall. 


I have now completed my Google Homepage; Finished JUL 9th 8pm 
I have learned so much from this project. Mostly about Flex objects and positioning of objects around the screen. 
It is deceptive looking, honestly. The Google homepage is so clean and minimal, that it looks like it should be easy. However, Ducky and I perserved through. 

I think I learned a lot, and it's pretty close graphically to the original (As of 9th of Jul 2021). But wow that html and css for the original... It's so complicated, and the class naming (I've now learned that it was minified)?? But I learned just how vaulable the Dev Tools are, and not just for peeking at the code of a site to learn how to do things. I utilized it extensively for looking at my own code, finding where things were messing up, and why things weren't working. 
Anyway, thanks for coming to this CodeTalk :P
